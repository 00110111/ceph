12.0.0
------

 * The omap_get_keys and omap_get_vals librados functions have been deprecated
   in favor of omap_get_vals2 and omap_get_keys2.  The new methods include an
   output argument indicating whether there are additional keys left to fetch.
   Previously this had to be inferred from the requested key count vs the
   number of keys returned, but this breaks with new OSD-side limits on the
   number of keys or bytes that can be returned by a single omap request.  These
   limits were introduced by kraken but were effectively disabled (by setting a
   very large limit of 1 GB) because users of the newly deprecated interface
   cannot tell whether they should fetch more keys or not.
