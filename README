The basic idea is that the set of tests to run consists of all
combinations of taking one yaml fragment from each facet.

Each directory represents a facet.  For example, given the files

  clusters/
  clusters/fixed-3.yaml
  clusters/fixed-9.yaml
  tasks/
  tasks/a
  tasks/b
  tasks/c

teuthology-suite would run tasks a, b, and c on both fixed-3 and fixed-9
clusters.  

Note that the 'clusters' and 'tasks' terminology is actually
meaningless here.  All teuthology-suite does is stick the yaml
fragments together (one from each facet) and run teuthology on the
result (optionally combined with any additional fragments passed on
the command line).


That is the current approach.  Eventually we may want something
smarter, like different collections of facets, or some other way to
limit the total size of the test space (e.g., running certain tasks
only on certain clusters).
